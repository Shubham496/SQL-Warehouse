# Data Warehouse Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a **Data Warehouse** from a sample database. The goal is to design, implement, and optimize a data warehouse system that allows for efficient querying and reporting. The data warehouse will integrate data from multiple sources, transforming and structuring it for analysis and decision-making.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a Data Warehouse based on a sample database.
- Use Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to migrate data into the Data Warehouse.
- Create a star schema or snowflake schema to organize the data.
- Perform necessary data transformations to make it suitable for analysis.
- Provide easy-to-understand documentation and an interactive environment for reporting.

## Features

- **ETL Process**: Extract data from source tables, transform it into a suitable format, and load it into the Data Warehouse.
- **Schema Design**: Implemented star or snowflake schema for effective data storage and retrieval.
- **Optimized Queries**: Designed optimized queries for fast reporting and analytics.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean and transform data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data consistency during migration and loading.
- **Sample Database**: A small database with relevant data used as the source.

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server (or any relational DBMS you are using)
- **ETL Tools**: Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) / Apache Nifi / Talend (Choose based on your implementation)
- **Data Modeling**: SQL (Star/Snowflake Schema design)
- **Version Control**: Git / GitHub

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-warehouse-project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (If using Python):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your database:

   - Create a new database in your SQL Server / PostgreSQL / MySQL instance.
   - Run the provided SQL scripts to create the sample database tables.

4. Configure the ETL process (if applicable):

   - Modify the configuration files to specify your database credentials and other settings.
   
5. Run the ETL process:

   ```bash
   python etl_process.py
   ```

6. Query the Data Warehouse to validate the loaded data.

## Structure

Here’s a quick overview of the directory structure:

```
data-warehouse-project/
├── src/                    # Contains all scripts for the ETL process and transformations
│   ├── etl_process.py      # Main ETL script
│   ├── transformation.py   # Data transformation logic
│   └── schema.py           # Schema design and creation
├── sql/                    # SQL scripts for database setup and queries
│   ├── create_tables.sql   # SQL script to create sample database tables
│   ├── load_data.sql       # SQL script for initial data loading
│   └── queries.sql         # Common queries for testing and reporting
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── README.md               # This file
```

## Usage

Once the ETL process is completed, you can start querying the Data Warehouse for analysis or use reporting tools to visualize the data. Use the provided queries for testing or create your own to suit specific requirements.

### Example Queries

- Fetch all customer orders:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customer_orders;
   ```

- Get sales by region:

   ```sql
   SELECT region, SUM(sales) 
   FROM sales_data
   GROUP BY region;
   ```
